| **Document Overview**Campaign: Campaign 2 — Heavy Duty Towing & Commercial RecoveryTarget Audience: Fleet managers, logistics coordinators, construction firms, trucking companies, bus operators, freight companiesPrimary Conversions: Phone call (emergency) + Fleet quote form submission (B2B relationship)Primary Keywords: semi truck towing Bay Area, heavy duty towing Bay Area, fleet towing SLA, rotator recovery Bay Area, commercial towingKey Differentiator: 75+ ton rotator fleet, SLA contracts, DOT/OSHA/CTTA/ITRA certified, 6 Bay Area dispatch hubsSections: 12 sections | Format: CRO-optimized web copy + design notes + buyer psychology calloutsVersion: v2 — GKP Enhanced (October 2025 Bay Area Data) |
|---|

| **SECTION 1 — HERO (Above the Fold)** |
|---|

# **HERO SECTION**

Dual CTA: Emergency call + Fleet quote form. Capability-first messaging.

| **🎨 DESIGN / DEVELOPER NOTE:**Full-width hero with dark navy background or dramatic rotator/semi-truck photography. Primary CTA: CALL NOW (orange button). Secondary CTA: REQUEST FLEET QUOTE (outlined/navy). Stats bar immediately below. B2B buyers research more than C1 — the form CTA captures non-emergency inquiry traffic. |
|---|

**HEADLINE:**

| **Bay Area's #1 Semi Truck Towing. 75+ Ton Heavy Recovery, 24/7.**Semi-truck, 18-wheeler & heavy equipment recovery — fleet contracts, rotator service, 5 Bay Area counties. |
|---|

# **DUAL CTA BUTTONS:**

| **📞  CALL NOW — 650-881-2400** | **REQUEST A FLEET QUOTE  →** |
|---|---|

**TRUST CHIPS (below CTAs):**

| **75+ Tons** | **Rotator Fleet** | **DOT Compliant** | **CTTA + ITRA** | **SLA Available** | **24/7 Dispatch** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| **📊 BUYER PSYCHOLOGY (Phase 2 Insight):**C2 buyers (fleet managers, logistics coordinators) are capability-first. 'Can they handle my equipment?' is question #1. '75+ Tons' and 'Rotator Fleet' in the headline immediately answers that. Dual CTA serves two modes: emergency dispatch (call) and planned procurement (fleet quote form). B2B buyers may need to involve procurement or get multiple quotes — the form captures that journey. |
|---|

| **SECTION 2 — CAPABILITY STATS BAR** |
|---|

**Heavy Duty — By the Numbers**
The fleet specs that matter to commercial operators.

| **🎨 DESIGN / DEVELOPER NOTE:**Full-width navy bar. 6 capability stats with numbers and labels. Different from C1 trust bar — this is capability-focused, not social proof-focused. Answers 'can they handle my equipment?' immediately. |
|---|

| **75+ Tons**Max Recovery Capacity | **50,000+**Total Tows Completed | **6 Hubs**Bay Area Dispatch Points | **24/7**Commercial Dispatch | **SLA**Fleet Contracts Available | **Rotator**Recovery Fleet On Call |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| **💰 FLEET DOWNTIME COST (Phase 2 Research):**Industry benchmark: commercial vehicle downtime costs $79.33/hour (ATRI, 2023). A 4-hour recovery delay costs $317. A wrong-truck dispatch (light-duty sent to a semi) costs 2-3 additional hours of delay. Capability confirmation at the hero level prevents costly dispatch errors and builds immediate trust. |
|---|

| **SECTION 3 — HEAVY DUTY SERVICE CAPABILITIES** |
|---|

**What We Recover & Transport — Heavy Duty**
If it's too big for anyone else, it's exactly right for us.

| **🎨 DESIGN / DEVELOPER NOTE:**5-card grid. Each card: emoji icon, bold service name, capability details, weight/size specifics. Navy or dark blue card top border. Light blue card background. Commercial buyers want specs — give them weight limits, vehicle types, equipment used. |
|---|

| **🚛 Semi-Truck & 18-Wheeler Towing**Class 7 & 8 commercial vehicles, tractor-trailers, articulated lorries. We dispatch dedicated heavy-duty units — no light-duty trucks attempting semi recovery. Loaded or unloaded trailers. Interstate and local. | **🔄 Heavy Recovery & Rotator Service**75+ ton rotator cranes for rollovers, jackknifed semis, off-road recoveries, and vehicles inaccessible to standard recovery units. Our rotator fleet handles recoveries other companies refuse. |
|---|---|

| **🚌 Bus & Transit Vehicle Towing**Municipal buses, charter coaches, school buses, transit vehicles. Proper towing points, no drivetrain damage. We work with transit agencies, school districts, and charter operators across the Bay Area. | **🏢 Fleet & Commercial Contract Towing**Dedicated SLA towing contracts for logistics companies, freight carriers, delivery fleets, and municipalities. Priority dispatch, monthly invoicing, dedicated account management, fleet reporting. |
|---|---|

| **🏗 Construction Equipment Transport**Excavators, bulldozers, skid steers, cranes, generators, scissor lifts. Lowboy trailers and specialized heavy transport. We coordinate permits for oversize/overweight loads where required. |  |
|---|---|

| **INTERSTATE & LONG-DISTANCE HAULING**We haul beyond the Bay Area. I-80 corridor to Sacramento, I-5 to LA, Hwy 99 Central Valley runs.Long-distance heavy hauling with full DOT compliance. Call for availability and routing.Stockton dispatch hub enables Central Valley and Interstate commercial coverage. |
|---|

| **📊 BUYER PSYCHOLOGY (Phase 2 Insight):**B2B buyers (fleet managers, construction supervisors) need to confirm capability before anything else. Weight ratings, specific vehicle types, and equipment names (rotator, lowboy) are capability signals they look for. Missing these specifics = losing the lead to a competitor who lists them. 'Other companies refuse' for rotator recoveries is a powerful exclusivity signal. |
|---|

| **SECTION 4 — HOW WE HANDLE COMMERCIAL RECOVERY** |
|---|

**How It Works — Commercial & Fleet Recovery**
From first call to clearance — a process built for commercial operators.

| **🎨 DESIGN / DEVELOPER NOTE:**4 numbered steps (commercial calls often require more coordination than C1). Include the specific differences from C1 process: incident command, CHP coordination, load assessment. This differentiates from generic towing companies. |
|---|

| **1****Call Dispatch — 24/7**One call reaches a commercial-capable dispatcher who understands weight classes, equipment types, and incident command. We speak your language. ETA confirmed within 60 seconds.📞 650-881-2400 | **2****Assessment & Right-Sizing**We assess equipment type, weight, incident nature (accident, breakdown, rollover) and dispatch the correctly spec'd unit. No second trips, no wrong trucks. Rotator, heavy-duty tow, lowboy — matched to your need. | **3****Scene Management & Recovery**Our operators work within incident command, coordinate with CHP and emergency services, and execute recovery with precision. We clear scenes efficiently — minimizing your downtime and roadway clearance time. | **4****Transport & Delivery**Safe transport to your preferred facility, yard, or repair shop. Full load security, DOT-compliant tie-down, driver log documentation. Fleet account holders receive delivery confirmation and paperwork. |
|---|---|---|---|

| **💰 FLEET DOWNTIME COST (Phase 2 Research):**Each hour of commercial downtime costs $79.33 on average (ATRI benchmark). A wrong-truck dispatch adds 2-3 hours of delay. Dispatching a rotator on the first call, rather than waiting for a second vehicle, can save $158-$237 in downtime per incident for a fleet customer. |
|---|

| **SECTION 5 — FLEET & COMMERCIAL CONTRACTS** |
|---|

**Fleet Towing Contracts — Built for Commercial Operations**
Priority response, volume pricing, dedicated account management. Stop calling a different towing company every time.

| **🎨 DESIGN / DEVELOPER NOTE:**This is the primary B2B conversion section. Two-column layout: left side lists fleet contract benefits, right side has a quote request form or CTA. This is where fleet managers and procurement officers convert. High-value section — design it clearly and professionally. |
|---|

| **What Fleet Accounts Include:**Priority Dispatch — Fleet calls jump the queue. Your vehicles are never waiting behind retail calls.Volume Pricing — Monthly invoicing with volume-based rate schedules. No per-call credit card surprises.Dedicated Account Manager — One point of contact for scheduling, invoicing, and incident reports.SLA Response Guarantees — Contractual response time commitments for your coverage area.Fleet Reporting — Monthly tow logs, cost breakdowns, and incident reports for your records.Multi-County Coverage — Single contract covering all 5 Bay Area counties + Central Valley corridor. | **Who We Work With:**Logistics & Freight Companies — FedEx, UPS, and regional freight carriers operating in the Bay Area.Construction Companies — Equipment operators, GCs, subcontractors with heavy machinery.Municipal & Transit — City buses, county fleets, transit authorities, school districts.Trucking Companies — Owner-operators, regional carriers, intermodal operators.Corporate Fleet Managers — Multi-vehicle company fleets needing a single towing vendor. |
|---|---|

| **📊 BUYER PSYCHOLOGY (Phase 2 Insight):**B2B buyers (Persona 1: Fleet Operations Manager, Persona 2: Logistics Coordinator) want a relationship, not a transaction. The SLA, priority dispatch, volume pricing, and dedicated account manager are the triggers that move them from one-time caller to contract client. The email option matters — procurement buyers often can't call during work hours. |
|---|

| **SECTION 6 — CERTIFICATIONS & COMPLIANCE** |
|---|

**Certified. Compliant. Insured.**
The credentials commercial operators require from a towing partner.

| **🎨 DESIGN / DEVELOPER NOTE:**Certification badges/logos with explanations. 4-6 certs listed clearly. B2B buyers must verify vendor credentials for liability and insurance purposes — this section makes that easy. Consider downloadable COI or certification docs for enterprise prospects. |
|---|

| **CTTA** | **California Tow Truck Association**State-level professional towing certification. CTTA members meet California's highest standards for equipment, training, and business practices. |
|---|---|

| **ITRA** | **International Towing & Recovery Association**International heavy-duty recovery certification. ITRA credentials confirm capability in complex recoveries — including rollovers, jackknifes, and multi-vehicle incidents. |
|---|---|

| **DOT** | **Department of Transportation Compliant**Full DOT compliance for commercial vehicle operations. Driver logs, vehicle inspections, weight limits, and tie-down regulations — all followed, every run. |
|---|---|

| **OSHA** | **OSHA-Trained Operators**All operators complete OSHA safety training for hazard recognition, incident scene management, and personal protective equipment protocols. |
|---|---|

| **Certificate of Insurance Available on Request**Fleet and enterprise accounts can request our Certificate of Insurance (COI) for vendor onboarding.Contact: dispatch@heavytowpro.com | 650-881-2400 |
|---|

| **📊 BUYER PSYCHOLOGY (Phase 2 Insight):**B2B buyers carry personal liability for vendor selection. If an uncertified towing company damages a $200K excavator or causes a highway incident, the fleet manager who hired them is accountable. Certifications are not marketing — they are vendor qualification checkboxes. List them explicitly, with plain-language explanations of what each means. |
|---|

| **SECTION 7 — COMMERCIAL TESTIMONIALS / CASE STUDIES** |
|---|

**What Commercial Operators Are Saying**
Real recoveries. Real stakes. Real results.

| **🎨 DESIGN / DEVELOPER NOTE:**3 testimonials — one per major B2B persona. Focus on outcomes: downtime saved, cost avoided, capability confirmed, professionalism. Include vehicle type and business context. B2B buyers identify with business outcomes, not personal emotions. |
|---|

| ★★★★★*"Our excavator rolled off the transport pad during offloading — 62,000 lbs on its side. Most companies said they couldn't handle it. Heavy Haulers arrived with a rotator in under an hour and uprighted it without additional damage. Got our project back on schedule same day."***Robert M.**  |  Construction Project Manager*Excavator Rollover Recovery* | ★★★★★*"We run 45 delivery trucks across the Bay Area. I used to call whoever answered — different company every time, different quality every time. Since signing a fleet contract with Heavy Haulers, every call is handled the same way. Priority dispatch, invoice at month end, no surprises."***David K.**  |  Fleet Operations Manager*Fleet Contract — Delivery Company* | ★★★★★*"Jackknifed semi on 880 at 2am. They had a heavy-duty unit on scene in 22 minutes, coordinated with CHP for lane closure, and cleared the incident in under 3 hours. That's how you save $2,000 in insurance escalation costs in one call."***Marcus T.**  |  Logistics Coordinator*Semi Recovery — I-880* |
|---|---|---|

| **💰 FLEET DOWNTIME COST (Phase 2 Research):**David K.'s fleet contract story illustrates the core B2B value proposition: consistency and predictability over ad-hoc quality. Marcus T.'s story quantifies downtime cost savings ($2,000 in a single incident). Robert M.'s story confirms rotator capability for high-stakes recoveries. Each testimonial targets a specific C2 persona from Phase 2. |
|---|

| **SECTION 8 — COVERAGE AREA & DISPATCH HUBS** |
|---|

**5 Counties. 6 Dispatch Hubs. One Contract.**
Bay Area-wide commercial coverage with strategic hub positioning.

| **🎨 DESIGN / DEVELOPER NOTE:**Coverage focus for C2 is different from C1: show highway corridor coverage (I-80, I-880, I-101, I-580), port access (Port of Oakland), and interstate reach. Commercial operators care about route coverage, not just cities. |
|---|

| **Santa Clara County ★ Highest Volume** | San Jose industrial parks, Milpitas, Sunnyvale, I-101 & Hwy 237 commercial corridors |
|---|---|

| **Alameda County** | Port of Oakland, I-880 industrial corridor, Hayward, Fremont, Livermore (I-580) |
|---|---|

| **San Francisco County** | Financial District, SoMa, Bayview, Highway 101 corridor, Bay Bridge approaches |
|---|---|

| **San Mateo County** | South SF, Port of San Francisco, SFO corridor, Redwood City, Hwy 101 & 280 corridors |
|---|---|

| **Contra Costa County** | Richmond (Port), Concord, Antioch (I-4), Brentwood, I-680/780 corridors |
|---|---|

| **Central Valley (Stockton Hub)** | I-80 east, I-5 corridor, Stockton Port, Modesto, Sacramento long-haul routes |
|---|---|

**DISPATCH HUBS — COMMERCIAL CONTACT:**

| **🏢  Brisbane (HQ)** | 351 Industrial Way, Brisbane, CA 94005 | **650-881-2400** |
|---|---|---|

| **🏢  Oakland Hub** | Serving Alameda County + Port of Oakland | **510-800-3800** |
|---|---|---|

| **🏢  San Jose Hub** | Serving Santa Clara County industrial corridor | **408-800-3800** |

|---|---|---|

| **🏢  Concord Hub** | Serving Contra Costa, I-680/780 corridor | **Available via HQ dispatch** |
|---|---|---|

| **📊 BUYER PSYCHOLOGY (Phase 2 Insight):**Fleet managers and logistics coordinators think in routes, not neighborhoods. Listing highway corridors (I-880, I-101, Port of Oakland) directly addresses the 'do you cover my operational routes?' question. The Stockton hub and Central Valley mention is a competitive differentiator — most Bay Area towing companies stop at county borders. |
|---|

| **SECTION 9 — COMMERCIAL FAQ** |
|---|

**Commercial Towing FAQs**
Questions fleet managers and commercial operators ask before signing.

| **🎨 DESIGN / DEVELOPER NOTE:**8 FAQs. B2B-focused — heavier on capability specs, contract terms, compliance, and SLA. Schema markup (FAQPage) recommended for SEO. Answers should be authoritative and specific — this audience knows the industry. |
|---|

| **Q: What is your maximum recovery weight?** |
|---|
| A: Our rotator fleet handles recoveries up to 75+ tons. This covers Class 8 semis, loaded trailers, large construction equipment, and multi-vehicle incidents. For extremely complex recoveries, we can assess on-site and bring additional equipment if required. Call to discuss your specific situation. |

| **Q: Do you handle jackknifed semis and rollover recoveries?** |
|---|
| A: Yes — this is core to our heavy-duty capability. Our rotator-equipped units are specifically designed for jackknifes, rollovers, and off-road recoveries. We carry out-rigger stabilization, air bags, and snatch block rigging for complex recovery scenarios. We coordinate with CHP and incident command. |

| **Q: Can you tow loaded trailers?** |
|---|
| A: Yes. We tow loaded trailers — both with the tractor attached and as independent trailer moves. For oversized or overweight configurations, we advise on permit requirements and can coordinate permitted loads where necessary. |

| **Q: Do you offer fleet/SLA towing contracts?** |
|---|
| A: Yes. We offer dedicated fleet contracts for commercial operators with monthly invoicing, priority dispatch, volume pricing, dedicated account management, and SLA response time commitments. Contact dispatch@heavytowpro.com or call 650-881-2400 for a custom fleet quote. |

| **Q: Are you DOT compliant? Can I see your credentials?** |
|---|
| A: Yes — fully DOT compliant. We also hold CTTA (California Tow Truck Association), ITRA (International Towing & Recovery Association), and OSHA training certifications. Certificate of Insurance available on request for fleet onboarding. Email dispatch@heavytowpro.com. |

| **Q: Do you cover interstate routes and long-distance hauls?** |
|---|
| A: Yes. We operate on all major Bay Area interstate corridors (I-80, I-880, I-101, I-580, I-680) and can haul to Sacramento, Stockton, Modesto, and beyond. Long-distance routes are available — call for specific route availability and pricing. |

| **Q: How do you handle after-hours commercial emergencies?** |
|---|
| A: We dispatch 24/7, including holidays. Commercial emergencies don't wait for business hours, and neither do we. Fleet account holders receive priority dispatch at any hour. After-hours calls are answered by the same commercial-capable dispatchers — not an answering service. |

| **Q: Can you work within incident command and with CHP?** |
|---|
| A: Yes. Our operators are trained for incident scene management and work within established incident command structures. We coordinate directly with CHP, fire departments, and emergency services — we don't create additional chaos at your scene. |

| **📊 BUYER PSYCHOLOGY (Phase 2 Insight):**C2 buyers research more thoroughly before committing — especially for fleet contracts. These 8 FAQs remove the final objections: capability doubt (max weight, rotator), compliance concern (DOT/CTTA), procurement process (COI, contract terms), geographic coverage (routes, interstate). Answering these comprehensively eliminates the need for a competitor comparison. |
|---|

| **SECTION 10 — DUAL CONVERSION ZONE (Emergency + Fleet)** |
|---|

**Ready to Move Heavy?**
Emergency dispatch or fleet contract — both handled right here.

| **🎨 DESIGN / DEVELOPER NOTE:**Full-width dark navy section split into two halves: left for emergency call (orange button), right for fleet quote form/link (outlined button). Clear visual separation of the two conversion paths. B2B conversion journeys are longer — give both paths equal visual weight. |
|---|

| **EMERGENCY DISPATCH**Semi down. I-880 incident. Rollover on 101. We answer immediately.Live dispatcher. ETA in 60 seconds. 24/7 / 365. | **FLEET CONTRACT INQUIRY**Multiple vehicles. Recurring needs. Want priority dispatch and volume pricing?Or email: dispatch@heavytowpro.com |
|---|---|

| **📊 BUYER PSYCHOLOGY (Phase 2 Insight):**C2 buyers have two distinct conversion moments: emergency dispatch (immediate, call-driven) and fleet procurement (planned, form-driven). Giving both equal visual weight captures both buyer modes. The email option for fleet inquiry is critical — procurement officers often cannot make calls during approvals processes. |
|---|

| **SECTION 11 — COMMERCIAL RISK REVERSAL** |
|---|

**Our Commercial Promise**
What we guarantee to every fleet customer and commercial operator.

| **🎨 DESIGN / DEVELOPER NOTE:**4 guarantee cards. B2B-focused guarantees are about liability, professionalism, and predictability — not just customer service. Include insurance/COI mention. Fleet managers must justify vendor selection to their superiors — these guarantees give them the language. |
|---|

| **🛡 Right Equipment. First Dispatch.**We assess your vehicle or equipment correctly on the first call and dispatch the right unit. No light-duty trucks attempting heavy-duty work. If we can't handle your specific situation, we tell you immediately — and refer you to someone who can. | **🛡 Full Cargo Liability Insurance**We carry comprehensive cargo liability insurance for all commercial tows. COI available on request for vendor onboarding. Your equipment is protected — and your procurement paperwork is covered. |
|---|---|

| **🛡 DOT-Compliant Operations, Every Run**Every tow is executed under full DOT compliance — driver logs, tie-down standards, weight limits, safety protocols. No shortcuts. No liability exposure for your company because of our non-compliance. | **🛡 SLA Accountability for Fleet Accounts**Fleet contract holders receive contractual response time commitments. If we miss an SLA, we acknowledge it, document it, and credit your account. We stand behind our service levels in writing. |
|---|---|

| **📊 BUYER PSYCHOLOGY (Phase 2 Insight):**B2B risk reversal is about professional accountability, not personal reassurance. 'COI available for vendor onboarding' removes a procurement blocker. 'DOT compliance' removes liability exposure fear. 'SLA accountability in writing' removes the risk of recommending a vendor who doesn't perform. Each promise speaks to a specific B2B persona fear from Phase 2. |
