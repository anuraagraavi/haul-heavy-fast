**HEAVY HAULERS**
*operating as HeavyTowPro*
Company Research & Market Analysis
Google Ads Campaign Foundation Document — Phase 1
San Francisco Bay Area | February 2026

# **1. Executive Summary**
Heavy Haulers — operating publicly as HeavyTowPro — is a professional towing, recovery, and hauling company headquartered in Brisbane, CA, with 6 dispatch hubs spanning the San Francisco Bay Area and Central Valley. The company delivers a deliberate, focused service model: full-spectrum towing capability (light, medium, and heavy-duty) without diluting quality through low-value roadside add-ons such as lockouts, battery jumps, or fuel delivery.
Their market position is built on four pillars: speed (average 15-minute dispatch response), transparency (upfront pricing, no hidden fees), capability (vehicles up to 75+ tons), and professionalism (licensed, DOT-compliant, CTTA & ITRA member operators). This makes them one of the most capable and systematically run towing operators in the Bay Area.

| **Campaign Structure Implication** HeavyTowPro is NOT a generalist roadside assistance service — they are a premium towing and recovery specialist. This distinction is critical for ad copy, keyword selection, and landing page messaging. Every campaign element must reflect speed, capability, and trust — not price competition. |

# **3. Services Offered**
Heavy Haulers operates a deliberately focused service model. Unlike most Bay Area towing competitors who bundle roadside add-ons, Heavy Haulers concentrates exclusively on towing, recovery, and hauling — maximising fleet utilisation and operator expertise. This focus is a strategic differentiator and should be reflected in all ad messaging.

| **Services NOT Offered — Strategic Exclusions (Important for Ad Copy)** **Heavy Haulers deliberately DOES NOT offer: Battery jumpstarts | Tire changes | Lockout services | Gas/fuel delivery** This is a strategic decision to maintain fleet quality and operator focus. Ad campaigns must NOT include keywords targeting these excluded services. Negative keywords for these terms should be added to all campaigns. |
| --- |

# **4. Geographic Coverage & Dispatch Network**

## **4.3 Key Highway & Freight Corridors**
Heavy Haulers' multi-hub placement gives them strategic coverage of the Bay Area's highest-volume towing corridors:
- I-80 (Bay Bridge / Eastshore Corridor) — SF ↔ Oakland ↔ Stockton (covered by SF, Brisbane, San Leandro, and Stockton hubs)
- US-101 (Peninsula Corridor) — SF ↔ San Mateo ↔ San Jose (Brisbane + San Mateo + San Jose hubs)
- I-880 (East Bay Industrial/Port Corridor) — Oakland ↔ Fremont ↔ Hayward (San Leandro + Hayward hubs)
- I-280 (Westside Peninsula) — SF ↔ Daly City ↔ San Jose
- I-580 (Tri-Valley) — Oakland ↔ Livermore ↔ Tracy
- I-680 (East Bay to South Bay) — Concord ↔ San Jose
- I-5 / SR-99 (Central Valley) — Stockton area freight corridor

# **5. Operations, Training & Standards**

## **5.1 Response Time Standards**

| **Response Time Commitment** Light-Duty: 15–30 minutes (primary service areas) | Medium/Commercial: 20–45 minutes (priority dispatch) | Overall Average: 15 minutes

This is a critical USP — the average Bay Area competitor quotes 30–60 minutes. HeavyTowPro's 15-minute average is a headline-worthy differentiator for ad copy. |
| --- |

## **5.2 Training & Certification Programme**
- Monthly safety and equipment certification updates — operators maintain current certification continuously
- Advanced rigging and recovery technique workshops — critical for heavy-duty and complex recovery scenarios
- Customer service excellence training — professional, courteous interaction at every touchpoint
- Emergency response protocol drills — preparedness for high-stress, complex recovery situations

## **5.3 Communication & Customer Experience Standards**
- Real-time updates during service calls — customers never left wondering where the truck is
- Multilingual dispatch capabilities — serving the Bay Area's diverse population
- Transparent pricing discussions before work begins — no surprise charges
- Free quotes within 15 minutes during business hours — quotes valid for 7 days
- Post-service feedback surveys and quality assurance reviews — continuous improvement loop

# **6. Licensing, Compliance & Certifications**
Heavy Haulers operates with full regulatory compliance — a critical trust signal in the towing industry where unlicensed operators are a persistent consumer concern.

| **Credential / Compliance** | **Detail** |
| --- | --- |
| **California Commercial Towing Licences** | Full licences and permits for all vehicle weight classes — light through heavy-duty |
| **DOT Compliance** | All vehicles and operators Department of Transportation compliant |
| **OSHA Safety Training** | Operators OSHA-trained for worksite and roadside safety standards |
| **Heavy Equipment Certifications** | Specialised certifications for complex rigging and recovery equipment operations |
| **Liability & Cargo Insurance** | Comprehensive coverage including specialised insurance for high-value luxury and exotic vehicles |
| **CTTA Membership** | California Tow Truck Association — industry body membership confirms legitimacy and standards adherence |
| **ITRA Membership** | International Towing & Recovery Association — global professional standards membership |

# **7. Pricing Model**
Heavy Haulers operates a transparent, no-hidden-fee pricing model — a deliberate departure from industry norms where surcharges and inflated after-hours rates are common. This is a primary conversion driver for both landing pages and ad extensions.

| **Service Tier** | **Bay Area Market Rate** | **HeavyTowPro Model** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Light-Duty Towing** | Starting ~$90–$150+ | Transparent upfront quote, no hidden fees, 7-day quote validity |
| **Medium-Duty Towing** | $200–$450+ (call required) | Upfront quote, call or online within 15 min |
| **Heavy-Duty Recovery** | $500–$5,000+ (complex jobs) | Custom quote, fleet SLA pricing available |
| **Fleet / Commercial Accts** | Variable / negotiated | Volume pricing, SLA contracts, dedicated account mgmt |

# **8. Target Customer Segments**

## **8.1 Light & Medium Duty — Primary Customer Segments**
- Everyday Bay Area motorists (commuters, residents, tourists with rental cars)
- Luxury and exotic vehicle owners requiring white-glove flatbed transport
- Motorcycle owners needing specialist two-wheel transport
- Rideshare and gig economy drivers (vehicle reliability directly impacts income)
- RV, motorhome, and camper van owners
- Food truck operators — specialty commercial vehicles requiring careful rigging
- Property managers — private property towing contracts
- Insurance company referrals — policyholders requiring tow service

## **8.2 Heavy Duty — Primary B2B Customer Segments**
- Trucking companies and freight carriers (LTL/FTL, owner-operators, regional fleets)
- Construction companies — broken-down or stranded equipment on job sites and highways
- Bus and transit operators — school buses, charter coaches, municipal transit
- Municipalities and government fleet managers — public sector fleet recovery
- Logistics and distribution hubs — Amazon DSPs, UPS, FedEx contractors in Bay Area
- Silicon Valley tech companies — corporate fleet vehicles (employee shuttles, delivery vehicles)
- Industrial and manufacturing facilities with heavy equipment needs
- Agricultural operators (San Joaquin / Central Valley coverage via Stockton hub)
- Military and government entities — cleared for government vehicle recovery

# **9. B2B & Commercial Fleet Programme**
Heavy Haulers has a structured B2B offering — a significant revenue and differentiation opportunity that competitors rarely advertise effectively online. This programme should have its own presence in the heavy-duty campaign.
- Fleet Service Contracts — priority dispatch agreements for commercial fleet operators
- Service Level Agreements (SLAs) — guaranteed response times written into contract terms
- Volume Pricing — negotiated rates for high-frequency commercial towing accounts
- Dedicated Account Management — a named point of contact for fleet and commercial clients
- Interstate Hauling with Permit Management — cross-state transport with full regulatory handling
- Industries Served: Logistics, tech (Silicon Valley fleet vehicles), delivery businesses, municipalities, construction

| **B2B Ad Campaign Opportunity** Fleet and commercial account keywords (e.g., 'commercial towing contract Bay Area', 'fleet towing service San Jose') typically have very low competition and high value per conversion. The Stockton hub also opens Central Valley freight and agricultural equipment targeting. |
| --- |

# **10. Competitive Landscape**
The San Francisco Bay Area towing market is competitive but fragmented. Most operators specialise in a single service tier or serve a narrow geographic zone. Heavy Haulers' full-spectrum, multi-hub model is a genuine differentiator.

| **Competitor** | **Coverage** | **Service Focus** | **Est.** | **Threat** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **SF City Towing** | SF + Bay Area | Light + Heavy | Established | **HIGH** |
| **Auto Towing SF** | SF, Bay Area | All Duty Levels | 10+ yrs | **HIGH** |
| **Specialty Towing Bay Area** | SF, Oakland, Peninsula | All Duty, GPS | Since 1980 | **HIGH** |
| **Ben's Towing** | East Bay | Heavy + Fleet | Since 2002 | **MEDIUM** |
| **Ellison's Towing** | Bay Area Wide | Light + Medium | 90+ yrs | **MEDIUM** |
| **B&A Towing** | San Francisco | Light, Impound | Since 1968 | **MEDIUM** |
| **United Towing** | East Bay | Heavy + Medium | Established | **MEDIUM** |
| **Action Road Solutions** | Bay Area Wide | All Duty Levels | Since 1984 | **LOW-MED** |

## **10.1 Competitive Gaps & Opportunities**
- Response time gap: HeavyTowPro's 15-minute average is 2–4x faster than the typical Bay Area competitor quote of 30–60 minutes — this should be a headline claim in all ads.
- Digital marketing gap: Several long-established competitors (Ellison's, B&A, Specialty) have strong offline brand recognition but weak digital presence — Google Ads can outmanoeuvre them in search.
- Heavy-duty digital gap: Very few competitors actively run Google Ads for heavy-duty specific terms — expect lower CPCs and less auction pressure in this segment.
- B2B fleet gap: No competitor visibly markets fleet SLA contracts or dedicated account management online — a clear whitespace opportunity.
- Multi-county targeting gap: Most competitors focus on 1–2 counties; HeavyTowPro's 5-county + Central Valley reach is a unique scale advantage.
- Services exclusion gap: NOT offering roadside add-ons positions Heavy Haulers as a premium, specialist operator vs. generalist competitors — this should be framed as a quality signal, not a limitation.

# **11. Customer Commitments & Brand Promise**
Heavy Haulers has formalised four customer commitments that translate directly into ad copy messaging and landing page trust signals:

| **1** | Honest Communication — No surprises, no hidden fees. Price agreed before work begins. |
| --- | --- |
| **2** | Rapid Response — Fast dispatch prioritised. Average 15-minute response. 24/7 emergency availability. |
| **3** | Professional Care — Every vehicle treated as if it were the operator's own. White-glove standards for luxury and exotic vehicles. |
| **4** | Continuous Improvement — Post-service feedback surveys, quality assurance reviews, and team recognition programmes ensure service quality improves over time. |

# **12. Strategic Recommendations for Google Ads Campaigns**

| **Two-Campaign Architecture** Campaign 1: Light & Medium Duty — High volume, broad consumer audience, emergency/urgency focus, primary conversion = phone call. Campaign 2: Heavy Duty & Commercial — Lower volume, higher value, B2B and fleet focus, dual conversion = phone call + fleet quote form. |
| --- |

## **12.1 Light & Medium Duty Campaign Strategy**
- Lead with speed: '15-Min Response' and '24/7' are the primary message hooks — this is the #1 anxiety of a stranded motorist
- Use call extensions as the primary conversion — phone calls convert 5–10x better than forms for emergency towing
- Geotarget: All 5 counties with highest bid adjustments in San Francisco and San Mateo (Brisbane HQ proximity)
- Emphasise flatbed (no damage) and luxury/exotic towing capability for premium segments
- Exclude: battery, lockout, jumpstart, fuel delivery — add as negative keywords to avoid irrelevant clicks

## **12.2 Heavy Duty & Commercial Campaign Strategy**
- Lead with capability: '75+ Tons', 'Semi-Truck Recovery', 'Equipment Transport' as headline hooks
- Dual CTA: CALL NOW (emergency) + GET A FLEET QUOTE (B2B lead gen)
- Target I-880 (port/industrial corridor), I-80 (freight corridor), and I-5/SR-99 (Central Valley) by keyword intent
- Create a dedicated fleet/commercial ad group targeting SLA, contract, and volume pricing terms
- Geotarget: Broader Bay Area + bid boosts near port of Oakland, industrial zones, construction corridors

## **12.3 Negative Keyword Priorities (Both Campaigns)**
- Service exclusions: battery jump, jumpstart, lockout, fuel delivery, gas delivery, tire change
- Non-buyer intent: free, DIY, how to, job, career, hiring, employment
- Competitor brand names (unless running a competitor conquest campaign)
- Out-of-area cities and counties not served
